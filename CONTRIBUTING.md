# Contributing to lichess-board

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `lichess-board`! We welcome contributions from the community to help make this project better.

## Getting Started

This project uses `make` for common development tasks.

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10
- `pip`

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```
4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Code Quality and Linting

We maintain high code quality standards to ensure the project remains maintainable and bug-free. Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure your code passes all linting and type checking requirements.

We use the following tools:
- **Black**: For code formatting.
- **isort**: For sorting imports.
- **Flake8**: For style guide enforcement.
- **mypy**: For static type checking.

### Running Checks

You can run all checks easily using the `make` command:

- **`make check`**: Run all linting and type checking tools (`black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`).
- **`make test`**: Run the test suite using `pytest`.
- **`make clean`**: Remove autogenerated files and build artifacts.

Please ensure `make check` and `make test` pass before submitting your PR.

## Testing and Code Coverage

### Running Tests

You can run tests using the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage report
make coverage

# Run tests with coverage and open HTML report
make coverage-html
```

### Code Coverage Requirements

This project maintains a **minimum code coverage of 80%**. All tests must pass and coverage must meet this threshold before a PR can be merged.

- Coverage is automatically verified on every push and pull request via GitHub Actions
- The build will fail if coverage drops below 80%
- You can view detailed coverage reports in the `htmlcov/` directory after running `make coverage-html`

For detailed information on setting up code coverage verification on GitHub, see [COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md).

## Submitting Changes

2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. Make your changes.
4. Run `make check` and `make test` to verify your changes.
5. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes.
