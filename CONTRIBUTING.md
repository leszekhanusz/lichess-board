## Code Quality and Linting

We maintain high code quality standards to ensure the project remains maintainable and bug-free. Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure your code passes all linting and type checking requirements.

We use the following tools:
- **Black**: For code formatting.
- **isort**: For sorting imports.
- **Flake8**: For style guide enforcement.
- **mypy**: For static type checking.

### Running Checks

You can run all checks easily using the `make` command:

- **`make check`**: Run all linting and type checking tools (`black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`).
- **`make test`**: Run the test suite using `pytest`.
- **`make clean`**: Remove autogenerated files and build artifacts.

Please ensure `make check` and `make test` pass before submitting your PR.
